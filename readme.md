In this repostory you will find some of the scripts I developed during my internship as a Bioinformatics research support in the Animal Genomics area in the Centre for Research in Agricultural Genomics. 

Project 1: Statistical detection of Genomic Breeding Value (GEBV) correlated variants

- Random_Subsets_code.py: random selection of varaints to be plotted. 
- SNPs_Tests_code.py: statistical testing of each variant of a VCF, including Spearman, Fisher Exact Test, Pearson and Lineal Model.
- calculate_allele_freq.py: calculates the allelic frequency of each variant of a VCF using the number of reads that mapped to each option (var/ref).

Project 2: Variant calling and statistical detection of possible azoospermia-causal Structural Variants. 

- compare_VCFs_code.py: takes 2 VCFs and compares their variant content (rows), showing the result with a Venn Diagram.
